## To whom it may be useful?
This repository gathers some awesome writing examples for  the researchers and engineers who want to write a demo or industry track paper for their open-source AI projects, including but not limited to, ML/DL framework, Explainable AI(XAI), AutoML, Reinforcement Learning(RL). The resources are categorized into ML/DL engine, XAI, AutoML and RL these four types and taged into two types: Algorithm & Framework, and Platform & System.
 * Algorithm & Framework:  ðŸš€
 * Platform & System: ðŸ’»

## Engine
Engine part consists of some main stream computational framework for machine learning and deep learning applications. We didn't include the framework without a paper e.g. Keras, PyTorch though they are very excellent library because this repo mainly focus on the writing and literacy of an open-source library and project.
