## To whom it may be useful?
This repository gathers some awesome writing examples for  the researchers and engineers who want to write a demo or industry track paper for their open-source AI projects, including but not limited to, ML/DL framework, Explainable AI(XAI), AutoML, Reinforcement Learning(RL). The resources are categorized into ML/DL engine, XAI, AutoML and RL these four types and taged into two types: Algorithm & Framework, or Platform & System.

## Engine
Engine part consists of some main stream computational frameworks for machine learning and deep learning applications. We didn't include the framework without a paper e.g. Keras, PyTorch though they are very excellent libraries, because this repo mainly focuses on the writing and literacy of an open-source library and project.
